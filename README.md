# Visual-Wikipedia
Developing an idea of a visual (potentially text free) global knowledge platform. Causation and relation is to be represented by animation/graphics, mimmicing the real world on all levels (zoomable from galaxies to atoms).

The purpose of this repo is to gather ideas and potentially end up with a realistic design.

## visuals instead of text
The motivation for this is that brains are much better in pattern recognition on visuals than text (citation needed). So a visual Wikipedia would be easier to learn from, as it uses "native brain language". The problem is, that it would be harder to create and edit such a knowledge platform.
I believe visuals can be so much more educational as used in current context (walls of text with the occasional image).
Text is only our common communication tool since it is so easy to create, as a permanent copy of our vocal language expression. So in order for this project to succeed, it must inherently ease the creation of visuals.

## 2D Version
- Animations like from 3 Blue 1 Brown put into infinite scroll arena like prezi arond a single topic.
- Topics connected by global graph - we could probably just add that to the real Wikipedia


## 3D Version
A explorable 1:1 world simulator showing underworking principles.
Just a direct simulation might not be enough. We probably need to add explanatory arrows to show connections.

# Visual language
This is a seperate idea, hopefully useable in this context:

I always wondered if there could be a more effective written representation of knowledge. If we could use symbols to express logic faster.

But chances are this idea might just end up with either a symbolic language like chinese or the existing language of logic - math expressions.

## Verbs as arrows
To transform classic texts into visual logic we start with the classic grammar subject - verb - object. Subjects and objects both are things that often already have a known visual representation: üè†, üî® (wait, tools might intuitively be interpreted as verbs), üåç, üóº, üõû, üöô

The verb inbetween can be represented by different kinds of arrows.
And if we apply that idea to our Visual Wikipedia, we could just connect two visual objects with a defined arrow to formulate a classical sentence, visually.
So we need to develop a vocabluary of arrows.
